TASK 1: BASIC SMART CONTRACT DEVELOPMENT (500+ WORDS)

Task 1 focused on understanding the fundamentals of blockchain technology and smart contract development using Solidity. A smart contract is a self-executing program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain and automatically performs actions when predefined conditions are met. The main objective of this task was to gain hands-on experience with writing, compiling, and deploying a basic smart contract while understanding how blockchain transactions work.
To begin with, the Remix Ethereum IDE was used because it provides an online environment for writing Solidity code without installing any additional software. The smart contract was written using Solidity language, which is specifically designed for Ethereum-based applications. The contract included basic elements such as state variables, functions, constructors, and Ethereum addresses. These components helped in understanding how data is stored and modified on the blockchain.
The contract was compiled using the Solidity compiler available in Remix. During compilation, common issues such as version mismatch, syntax errors, and warnings were analyzed and resolved. This step helped in understanding how Solidity versions affect contract behavior and how compiler settings such as EVM version play an important role in successful deployment.
After compilation, the smart contract was deployed using the Remix Virtual Machine (VM), which simulates a blockchain environment in the browser. Deployment creates a unique contract address on the blockchain, allowing users to interact with the contract. The deployment process also demonstrated the importance of gas fees, transaction execution, and block confirmation.
Once deployed, the contract functions were tested by interacting with them through Remix. This interaction showed how function calls differ from transactions, how state changes occur, and how Ethereum handles data immutability. This task provided a strong foundation in blockchain basics and helped in understanding how decentralized applications operate without centralized control.
Overall, Task 1 was essential in building confidence in Solidity programming and blockchain concepts. It introduced real-world blockchain development practices and prepared the groundwork for more advanced tasks such as token creation and decentralized finance applications.
